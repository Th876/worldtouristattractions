# üåç World Tourist Attractions API  

## Project Overview  
World Tourist Attractions API is a custom RESTful API I designed to provide information about popular cities and their top tourist attractions. Users can search for a city within a country to retrieve the names, images, descriptions, and ticket information for each main attraction.  

**Disclaimer:** This API was created for **project and educational purposes only**. I made great efforts to use copyright-free images,however, some images may be subject to copyright. If using this API publicly, ensure compliance with copyright laws.  

## Features

- Provides images, descriptions, and ticket links (if applicable)  
- Built to be used with **any frontend application**  
- Uses a **MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js** for the backend  

## Technologies Used  
- **MongoDB**  
- **Express.js**  
- **Node.js** 
- **Postman**  
- **Git & GitHub**
